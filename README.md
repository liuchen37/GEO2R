**alysis through GEO2R**

GEO2R is a built-in tool in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). It compares the expression of target genes in different groups and produces a set of figures to visualize the difference. GEO2R is based on the r package *GEOquary* and *limma*. However, GEO2R does not consider the quality of chips.
