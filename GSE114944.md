### General information
Identifying tumor antigen-specific T cells from cancer patients has been a goal of tumor immunologists for several decades. Co-expression of CD103 and CD39 on CD8 TIL highly enriches for tumor-reactive T cells. CD39+CD103+ CD8 TIL have a distinct TCR repertoire compared to other CD8 TIL subsets and are clonally expanded within the tumor. They are highly enriched for tumor antigen recognition and efficiently killed autologous tumor cells. Patients with head and neck cancer whose CD8 TIL contained a higher frequency of CD39+CD103+ cells experienced a greater overall survival. This work describes a simple and effective method for detecting tumor-reactive CD8 TIL.
